# Exercise 3: Build Advanced AI Workflows for Orders & Tickets

### Estimated Duration: 60 Minutes

## Overview

In this exercise, you will enhance your StoreOps Assistant by building advanced AI workflows that go beyond static knowledge responses. You will create dynamic topics that allow users to place orders and request support, while integrating your agent with external systems like Microsoft Dataverse and ServiceNow. These enhancements will enable your assistant to perform end-to-end operations such as order recording and automated ticket creation, making it more powerful and functional for real-world store operations.

## Objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Create a topic to record orders in Dataverse

- Task 2: Create a “Support Ticket” topic and integrate with ServiceNow

## Task 1: Create a topic to record orders in Dataverse

In this task, you will create a topic that allows users to place product orders using the StoreOps Assistant. The topic will collect essential details such as the product name, quantity, and delivery preferences. Once the user confirms the order, the assistant will trigger an action to store the order details in a Microsoft Dataverse table. This enables seamless tracking and management of customer orders within your store’s database.


## Task 2: Create a “Support Ticket” topic and integrate with ServiceNow

In this task, you will build a topic that enables users to request support by creating a service ticket. The topic will gather information like the issue description, urgency level, and user contact details. Once the data is collected, the agent will connect to ServiceNow and automatically generate a corresponding incident ticket. This integration ensures quick and efficient resolution of customer issues without manual ticket creation.
